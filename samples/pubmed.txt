AB  - BACKGROUND: Gamification is the use of game mechanics to promote engagement and 
      enjoyment of problem-solving in non-game situations. Gamification has been used 
      widely in recent years in industry and academia as a tool for training and 
      education. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of 
      gamification and digital game-based learning (DGBL), review the use of digital games 
      in health professional education, and provide suggestions for future use in pharmacy 
      curricula. DISCUSSION: Many examples of game-based learning in pharmacy and other 
      health professional curricula have been published, however the body of literature on 
      DGBL is less developed. Overall, evaluations of these techniques show that students 
      find them engaging and enjoyable. A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing DGBL 
      to non-game based learning in primary, secondary, post-secondary education found 
      that DGBL significantly enhances learning. Challenges to implementing game-based 
      learning are financial, cultural, and technological. CONCLUSION: Many areas of the 
      pharmacy curriculum could be appropriate for digital gamification. With more 
      students entering pharmacy school familiar with video games and game-based living 
      the time has come for pharmacy educators to explore how these instructional 
      technologies could benefit a new generation of pharmacy students. As serious games 
      are developed and researched in pharmacy curricula, test scores, student confidence 
      in knowledge and skills, and retention of knowledge and skills are all outcomes 
      that, if published, will help advance the adoption of DGBL into the pharmacy school 
      classroom.

TI  - The RETAIN Simulation-Based Serious Game-A Review of the Literature.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare8010003 [doi]
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Each year, over 13 million babies worldwide need help to breathe at 
      birth. While guidelines recommend the Neonatal Resuscitation Program course, medical 
      errors remain common. Frequent simulation training and assessment is needed to 
      address this competence gap; however, alternative approaches are needed to overcome 
      barriers to access. The RETAIN (REsuscitation TrAINing) simulation-based serious 
      game (Retain Labs Medical Inc., Edmonton, AB, Canada) may provide a solution to 
      supplement traditional training. This paper aims to review the available evidence 
      about RETAIN for improving neonatal resuscitation education. Method: Literature 
      searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
      CINAHL, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were performed to identify studies 
      examining the RETAIN serious game for neonatal resuscitation training. All of the 
      studies describing the RETAIN board game and computer game were included. Results: 
      Three papers and one conference proceeding were identified. Two studies described 
      the RETAIN board game, and two studies described the RETAIN computer game. RETAIN 
      was reported as usable and clinically relevant. RETAIN also improved knowledge of 
      neonatal resuscitation by 12% and functioned as a summative assessment. Further, 
      performance on RETAIN was moderated by players' self-reported mindset. Conclusion: 
      RETAIN can be used for the training and assessment of experienced neonatal 
      resuscitation providers. Further studies are needed to understand the effectiveness 
      of RETAIN to (i) improve other cognitive and non-cognitive skills, (ii) in diverse 
      populations of neonatal resuscitation providers, (iii) in comparison to current 
      standard training approaches, and (iv) in improving clinical outcomes in the 
      delivery room.

TI  - Game-based interventions and their impact on dementia: a narrative review.
PG  - 562-565
LID - 10.1177/1039856217726686 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to examine the efficacy of game-based 
      interventions for people with dementia. METHODS: Seven studies that met the 
      inclusion criteria were found in four databases. Their interventions and key 
      findings were analysed and synthesised. RESULTS: Game-based interventions for people 
      with dementia are showing promise for improving cognition, coordination and 
      behavioural and psychological symptoms. The generalisability of the findings is 
      limited by weak methodology and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Game-based 
      interventions can improve cognition, coordination and behavioural and psychological 
      symptoms for people with dementia. Future research should include methodological 
      improvement and practice guideline development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS) is a widely used measure of 
      video game addiction, a pathology affecting a small percentage of all people who 
      play video games. Emerging adult males are significantly more likely to be video 
      game addicts. Few researchers have examined how people who qualify as video game 
      addicts based on the IGDS compared to matched controls based on age, gender, race, 
      and marital status. METHOD: The current study compared IGDS video game addicts to 
      matched non-addicts in terms of their mental, physical, social-emotional health 
      using self-report, survey methods. RESULTS: Addicts had poorer mental health and 
      cognitive functioning including poorer impulse control and ADHD symptoms compared to 
      controls. Additionally, addicts displayed increased emotional difficulties including 
      increased depression and anxiety, felt more socially isolated, and were more likely 
      to display internet pornography pathological use symptoms. Female video game addicts 
      were at unique risk for negative outcomes. LIMITATIONS: The sample for this study 
      was undergraduate college students and self-report measures were used. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Participants who met the IGDS criteria for video game addiction displayed poorer 
      emotional, physical, mental, and social health, adding to the growing evidence that 
      video game addictions are a valid phenomenon.

      and typical development.
PG  - 523-528
LID - 10.1111/ped.13564 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Video game playing is a favorite leisure activity among children 
      worldwide. Individuals with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often 
      lack self-control, making them at risk for substance abuse and game addiction. There 
      are conflicting results, however, between studies on the pattern of video gaming and 
      game addiction between those with ADHD and healthy controls. We therefore compared 
      the pattern of video game use and game addiction between Thai children with ADHD and 
      healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 80 participants with ADHD (median age, 
      9.5 years) and 102 controls (median age, 10 years) were recruited in this study. 
      ADHD was diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician. Each control subject's teacher 
      completed the ADHD questionnaire to ensure that they did not have the diagnosis of 
      ADHD. Pattern of video game use and Game Addiction Screening Test (GAST) were 
      completed by participants' parents. RESULTS: More than half of the children with and 
      without ADHD spent >2 h/day playing video games rather than engaging in other 
      age-appropriate leisure activities, particularly on weekends. Participants with 
      ADHD, however, had a higher rate of compulsive video game use than controls (37.5% 
      vs 11.8%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although video game playing was relatively 
      prevalent in children regardless of ADHD status, those with ADHD had a higher rate 
      of problematic video game use than controls. The pattern of leisure activities 
      including video game use should be assessed during health supervision visits. As 
      such, those at risk for game addiction could be identified early, resulting in 
      appropriate intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have investigated injuries and treatments in the 
      baseball athlete. The majority of these studies have focused on the throwing 
      shoulder and elbow. However, more recent literature is reporting injuries to other 
      regions in this cohort, including the knee, head, hip, and hamstring. 
      PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of the current study was to determine the number and 
      type of injuries in Major League Baseball (MLB) and Minor League Baseball (MiLB) 
      players that do not occur during the actual game but are related to baseball 
      participation. Our hypothesis was that there would be a substantial number of 
      injuries that occurred in professional baseball players during non-game situations. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiological study. METHODS: Deidentified, anonymous 
      data were collected from the 2011 through 2016 seasons from the MLB Health and 
      Injury Tracking System (HITS) medical record database. All injuries that were 
      identified as a primary diagnosis and resulted in at least 1 day out of play from 
      both MLB and MiLB were examined. Injuries were categorized as occurring during the 
      game ("game" injuries) or not during the game. A "non-game" injury was defined as 
      occurring at any time other than during the scheduled game from the first to last 
      pitch. RESULTS: There were 51,548 total injuries in MLB and MiLB players from 2011 
      to 2016, almost 40% of which were attributed to non-game-related injuries (n = 
      19,201; 37.2%). The remainder occurred during a game (n = 32,347; 62.8%). A 
      significantly greater percentage of non-game injuries were season ending (10.8%) 
      compared with the percentage of game-related season-ending injuries (8.4%) (P < 
      .0001). Pitchers had significantly more non-game-related injuries than game-related 
      injuries (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: A large number of injuries occur in professional 
      baseball outside of actual games. MiLB players, specifically pitchers, are 
      particularly at risk for these types of injuries. It is feasible that the overall 
      injury rate in professional baseball players could be reduced by analyzing these 
      injuries in more detail to develop prevention strategies.

AB  - As a new type of addictive behaviors and distinct from traditional internet game 
      addiction on desktop computers, mobile game addiction has attracted researchers' 
      attention due to its possible negative effects on mental health issues. However, 
      very few studies have particularly examined the relationship between mobile game 
      addiction and mental health outcomes, due to a lack of specified instrument for 
      measuring this new type of behavioral addiction. In this study, we examined the 
      relationship between mobile game addition and social anxiety, depression, and 
      loneliness among adolescents. We found that mobile game addiction was positively 
      associated with social anxiety, depression, and loneliness. A further analysis on 
      gender difference in the paths from mobile game addiction to these mental health 
      outcomes was examined, and results revealed that male adolescents tend to report 
      more social anxiety when they use mobile game addictively. We also discussed 
      limitations and implications for mental health practice.
