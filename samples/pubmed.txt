AB  - BACKGROUND: Gamification is the use of game mechanics to promote engagement and 
      enjoyment of problem-solving in non-game situations. Gamification has been used 
      widely in recent years in industry and academia as a tool for training and 
      education. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of 
      gamification and digital game-based learning (DGBL), review the use of digital games 
      in health professional education, and provide suggestions for future use in pharmacy 
      curricula. DISCUSSION: Many examples of game-based learning in pharmacy and other 
      health professional curricula have been published, however the body of literature on 
      DGBL is less developed. Overall, evaluations of these techniques show that students 
      find them engaging and enjoyable. A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing DGBL 
      to non-game based learning in primary, secondary, post-secondary education found 
      that DGBL significantly enhances learning. Challenges to implementing game-based 
      learning are financial, cultural, and technological. CONCLUSION: Many areas of the 
      pharmacy curriculum could be appropriate for digital gamification. With more 
      students entering pharmacy school familiar with video games and game-based living 
      the time has come for pharmacy educators to explore how these instructional 
      technologies could benefit a new generation of pharmacy students. As serious games 
      are developed and researched in pharmacy curricula, test scores, student confidence 
      in knowledge and skills, and retention of knowledge and skills are all outcomes 
      that, if published, will help advance the adoption of DGBL into the pharmacy school 
      classroom.
