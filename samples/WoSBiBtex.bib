Abstract = {{Reach-avoid problems compute control laws under which a dynamic system
   can reach a desired set of states while avoiding another set. They are
   used in solving a variety of problems, such as goal-seeking and obstacle
   avoidance. Hamilton-Jacobi analysis provides a method for solving
   reach-avoid problems, through a corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)
   equation. Although the HJ equation can be utilized for a general class
   of problems, computing the solution of the HJ equation by grid-based
   methods has exponential complexity in the dimension of the continuous
   state. To alleviate this complexity, this letter presents a generalized
   version of the Hopf-Lax formula and proves its correctness for solving
   the reach-avoid problem. The method does not rely on discretization of
   the state space. A numerical algorithm for the proposed Hopf-Lax formula
   is presented, and demonstrated using a 12D vehicle example.}},

Title = {{Deceptive Labeling: Hypergames on Graphs for Stealthy Deception}},
Journal = {{IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing sophistication of attacks on cyber-physical systems,
   deception has emerged as an effective tool to improve system security
   and safety by obfuscating the attacker's perception. In this letter, we
   present a solution to the deceptive game in which a control agent is to
   satisfy a Boolean objective specified by a co-safe temporal logic
   formula in the presence of an adversary. The agent intentionally
   introduces asymmetric information to create payoff misperception, which
   manifests as the misperception of the labeling function in the game
   model. Thus, the adversary is unable to accurately determine which
   logical formula is satisfied by a given outcome of the game. We
   introduce a model called hypergame on graph to capture the asymmetrical
   information with one-sided payoff misperception. Based on this model, we
   present the solution of such a hypergame and use the solution to
   synthesize stealthy deceptive strategies. Specifically, deceptive sure
   winning and deceptive almost-sure winning strategies are developed by
   reducing the hypergame to a two-player game and one-player stochastic
   game with reachability objectives. A running example is introduced to
   demonstrate the game model and the solution concept used for strategy
   synthesis.}},

   Temporal Correlation}},

Abstract = {{For sequential betting games, Kelly's theory, aimed at maximization of
   the logarithmic growth of one's account value, involves optimization of
   the so-called betting fraction K. In this letter, we extend the
   classical formulation to allow for temporal correlation among bets. To
   demonstrate the potential of this new paradigm, for simplicity of
   exposition, we mainly address the case of a coin-flipping game with
   even-money payoff. To this end, we solve a problem with memory depth m.
   By this, we mean that the outcomes of coin flips are no longer assumed
   to be i.i.d. random variables. Instead, the probability of heads on flip
   k depends on previous flips k-1, k-2,..., k-m. For the simplest case of
   n flips, with m = 1, we obtain a closed form solution K-n for the
   optimal betting fraction. This generalizes the classical result for the
   memoryless case. That is, instead of fraction K{*} = 2p-1 which pervades
   the literature for a coin with probability of heads p >= 1/2, our new
   fraction K-n depends on both n and the parameters associated with the
   temporal correlation. Generalizations of these results for m > 1 and
   numerical simulations are also included. Finally, we indicate how the
   theory extends to time-varying feedback and alternative payoff
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{We design a distributed algorithm for learning Nash equilibria over
   time-varying communication networks in a partial-decision information
   scenario, where each agent can access its own cost function and local
   feasible set, but can only observe the actions of some neighbors. Our
   algorithm is based on projected pseudo-gradient dynamics, augmented with
   consensual terms. Under strong monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity of
   the game mapping, we provide a simple proof of linear convergence, based
   on a contractivity property of the iterates. Compared to similar
   solutions proposed in literature, we also allow for time-varying
   communication and derive tighter bounds on the step sizes that ensure
   convergence. In fact, in our numerical simulations, our algorithm
   outperforms the existing gradient-based methods, when the step sizes are
   set to their theoretical upper bounds. Finally, to relax the assumptions
   on the network structure, we propose a different pseudo-gradient
   algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge on time-varying balanced
   directed graphs.}},

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework for hardware architecture and learning algorithm
   co-design of multi-layer photonic spiking neural network (SNN). The
   vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser with an embedded saturable
   absorber (VCSEL-SA) which contains two polarization-resolved modes is
   employed as a spiking neuron. The connection between two identical
   polarization modes is considered as the excitatory synapse, whereas the
   connection between two orthogonal polarization modes is regarded as the
   inhibitory synapse. The physical model of the photonic spiking neuron is
   derived based on the combination of spin-flip model and Yamada model.
   The photonic spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is applied to
   design a hardware-friendly biologically plausible supervised learning
   algorithm for a multi-layer photonic SNN. Thanks to the polarization
   mode competition effect in the VCSEL-SA, the proposed neuromorphic
   network is capable of solving the classical XOR problem. The effect of
   physical parameters of photonic neuron on the training convergence is
   also considered. We further extend the multi-layer photonic SNN to
   realize other logic learning tasks. To the best of our knowledge, such a
   modified supervised learning algorithm dedicated for a multi-layer
   photonic SNN has not yet been reported, which is interesting for spiking
   learning of neuromorphic photonics.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to develop a modification of the model
   developed by Chen and Zhu in 2004. Calculating stage and overall
   efficiencies precisely and consistently has become a major challenge of
   the two-stage DEA model. However, most other models do not calculate the
   optimality of intermediates. Although the model developed by Chen and
   Zhu measures the optimality of intermediates, the calculated efficiency
   scores still have some shortfalls. The modified model, named the hybrid
   two-stage DEA model, fills the gap between calculating the optimality of
   intermediates and the consistency of overall efficiency scores. In
   addition to obtaining an accurate measurement for the optimality of
   intermediates, the model confines efficiency scores to a range from zero
   to one (a ratio efficiency score). In an empirical evaluation, we use
   data from 64 medical manufacturing firms to test the performance of the
   hybrid model and offer recommendations for the industry.}},
